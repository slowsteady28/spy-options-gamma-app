Hi, I'm **Eliezer Nunez** — an independent trader and data-driven market analyst with a focus on **SPY options gamma** and its impact on short-term price action.

Since 2019, I've been developing strategies rooted in market microstructure, gamma dynamics, and behavioral flow. My work blends **macro context**, **option positioning**, and **quant-driven insights** to understand where liquidity supports or pressures price.

This site provides ongoing commentary and analysis based on those models.
